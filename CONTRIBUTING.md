## Coding Standards for North Star

All source code files in this repository **must** begin with the following header:

```php
/**
 * File: [file_name]
 * Version: [version_number]
 * Author: North Star
 * Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
 * Purpose: [short description of what this file does]
 * 
 * Description:
 * [longer details about logic, usage, dependencies, etc.]
 */
```

- **Always use full code files when making changes or requesting help.**
- **Add robust comments throughout your code explaining what each major section does.**
- **Use clear, consistent file names and update the version number as you make changes.**
- The header template is always available in `HEADER_TEMPLATE.txt` in the repo root for easy copy-paste.

If you have any questions or need help, always ask for the full file, not just snippets.
